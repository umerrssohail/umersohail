I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley, with broad research interests in Public Finance, Macroeconomics and State Capacity. In my ongoing work, I investigate profit shifting and anti-tax avoidance regulations using tax data from Uganda. Additionally, I explore the impact of size-based tax policies on firm growth, productivity, and resource misallocation with tax data from Pakistan. I am also examining the role of banks and credit in supporting firm growth in emerging economies where equity markets are relatively thin.

I worked as predoc in economics at Columbia University for professors [Michael Best](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/mcb2270/) and [Jack J. Willis](https://sites.google.com/view/jwillis/). I completed my masters in economics from University of Manchester, where I was advised by [Mazhar Waseem](https://mazharwaseem.com).

I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics and Mathematics at the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Lahore. I am grateful to LUMS for funding my education through the [National Outreach Program](https://nop.lums.edu.pk/) scholarship.

In my free time, I immerse myself in the world of Punjabi music, from the vibrant beats of modern songs to the timeless essence of classical khayaal gayaaki. My interests also extend to the rich tradition of Punjabi poetry, along with a deep appreciation for the history and culture of Punjab.
