I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Delaware. My research lies at the intersection of international trade, development economics, and firm behavior, with a particular focus on how trade policy and legal institutions shape firm outcomes in developing countries.

My current work investigates the effects of trade liberalization on manufacturing firms in Pakistan, highlighting how changes in tariff structures impact firm productivity, market dynamics, and employment. In a separate line of research, I study how the enforcement of contracts and the assignment of judges in commercial courts influence firm performance in India. This project combines rich administrative firm data with detailed court records to explore how legal frictions affect economic efficiency.

My research agenda is driven by the broader question of how globalization interacts with institutional quality and state capacity in shaping economic development. I use microdata and causal inference techniques to understand how policy frameworks—particularly trade policy and judicial institutions—affect firm decisions, market allocation, and ultimately, growth and inequality.
