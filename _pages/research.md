# Working Papers

### 1. [The Impact of Trade Liberalization on Manufacturing Firms: Evidence from Pakistan]()  
**With:** [Shaheryar](#) (Duke University), [Zehra Farooq](#) (FBR, Pakistan)  
**Status:** Draft, *May 2025*

**Abstract:**  
We study how manufacturing firms in a developing economy adjust to trade liberalization using administrative tax records linked to firm-level tariff exposure. Exploiting variation in pre-reform protection and an event-study design, we document increases in export values, particularly among more productive firms. While less productive firms reduce wage expenditures following liberalization, more productive firms increase capital investment. Exit rates rise overall but are not disproportionately concentrated among low-productivity firms. These results highlight how liberalization triggers reallocation through exports, input adjustment, and firm dynamics, with heterogeneous effects shaped by productivity.

### 2. [Towards win-win: Evidence from commercial dispute resolution in India]()  
**With:** [Manaswini Rao](#) (University of Delaware), [Sandhya Seetharaman](#) (J-PAL), [Khushbu Shah](#) (J-PAL)  
**Status:** Draft, *October 2024*

**Abstract:**  
Courts are central in contract enforcement, and yet we know very little about how they function and their impact in the context of low state capacity. We leverage random assignment of commercial and contractual cases to judges in newly created commercial courts in India to examine the impact of judge-mediated settlement on litigating firms' profits. The resolution of a case through mutual reconciliation (``settlement'') rather than a full-length trial is negatively correlated with its duration and its pending status. We estimate a large, positive effect on the profitability of plaintiff, mainly financial sector firms, and negative effects among defendant firms. However, the negative effects among defendants are driven by the timing of suing rather than from settlement. We find suggestive evidence that settlement, in fact, stems the loss, suggesting a Pareto improvement.
