### 1. [The Impact of Trade Liberalization on Manufacturing Firms: Evidence from Pakistan]()  
**With:** [Shaheryar](#) (Duke University), [Zehra Farooq](#) (FBR, Pakistan)  
**Status:** Draft, *May 2025*

**Abstract:**  
We examine how manufacturing firms in a developing economy adjust to trade liberalization using administrative tax records linked to firm-level tariff exposure. Exploiting variation in pre-reform protection and an event-study framework, we find that export activity increases following liberalization, particularly among more productive firms. High-productivity firms expand their capital stock, while less productive firms reduce wage expenditures and show no evidence of investment-led adjustment. Although firm exit rates increase post-liberalization, the attrition is not disproportionately concentrated among low-productivity firms. These results highlight how liberalization induces resource reallocation through changes in exports, factor inputs, and firm dynamics, with adjustment patterns shaped by initial productivity.

### 2. [Towards win-win: Evidence from commercial dispute resolution in India]()  
**With:** [Manaswini Rao](#) (University of Delaware), [Sandhya Seetharaman](#) (J-PAL), [Khushbu Shah](#) (J-PAL)  
**Status:** Draft, *October 2024*

**Abstract:**  
Courts are central in contract enforcement, and yet we know very little about how they function and their impact in the context of low state capacity. We leverage random assignment of commercial and contractual cases to judges in newly created commercial courts in India to examine the impact of judge-mediated settlement on litigating firms' profits. The resolution of a case through mutual reconciliation (``settlement'') rather than a full-length trial is negatively correlated with its duration and its pending status. We estimate a large, positive effect on the profitability of plaintiff, mainly financial sector firms, and negative effects among defendant firms. However, the negative effects among defendants are driven by the timing of suing rather than from settlement. We find suggestive evidence that settlement, in fact, stems the loss, suggesting a Pareto improvement.
