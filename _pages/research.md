# Working Papers

### 1. [The Impact of Trade Liberalization on Manufacturing Firms: Evidence from Pakistan]()  
**With:** [Shaheryar](#) (Duke University), [Zehra Farooq](#) (FBR, Pakistan)  
**Status:** Draft, *May 2025*

**Abstract:**  
We study how manufacturing firms in a developing economy adjust to trade liberalization using administrative tax records linked to firm-level tariff exposure. Exploiting variation in pre-reform protection and an event-study design, we document increases in export values, particularly among more productive firms. While less productive firms reduce wage expenditures following liberalization, more productive firms increase capital investment. Exit rates rise overall but are not disproportionately concentrated among low-productivity firms. These results highlight how liberalization triggers reallocation through exports, input adjustment, and firm dynamics, with heterogeneous effects shaped by productivity.

### 2. [Contracts, Dispute Resolution, and Firm Productivity: Evidence from Commercial Courts in India]()  
**With:** [Manaswini Rao](#) (University of Delaware), [Sandhya Seetharaman](#) (J-PAL), [Khushbu Shah](#) (J-PAL)  
**Status:** Draft, *October 2024*

**Abstract:**  
Contract enforcement is central to capital access and firm-led structural transformation. Courts play a vital role by enabling contracts through timely resolution of debt recovery disputes, facilitating credit circulation and access to cheaper capital. We leverage the random assignment of commercial cases to judges in newly established commercial courts in India to estimate the impact of timely resolution on firm outcomes. We find that court-mediated settlements improve firm capital accumulation and profitability, and also influence repayment behavior and subsequent bank lending decisions.
